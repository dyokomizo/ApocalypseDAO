## Mission
Apocalypse Risk Management through Mutual Insurance

## Problem
Central points of failure are key bottlenecks in apocalypse risk management.

## Solution
Delivering insurance through decentralized mechanisms, a la DAO.

## DAO Design
### Reponomics
REP is not buyable. There are 3 levels of REP that members can be initialized with, by vote of current REP holders.
1. Creator: 10,000 REP
2. Contributor: 1,000 REP
3. Lurker: 100 REP

### Tokenomics
We are initializing ApocalypseDAO with a utility token model, where tokens are a local currency to access ApocalypseDAO products, services and coverage. Tokens can be purchased or earned through sweat. The token model is likely to change (as everything is everything in a DAO), and we look to the lifecycle of mutual insurance companies auspiciously.

### Proposal Types
Join Proposal: Submit a join proposal requesting the level of REP you feel entitled to (Creator, Contributor, Lurker). We recommend negotiating with current REP holding members.

Token Claim Proposal: Submit a proposal requesting token, including evidence and justification for your request.

Apocalypse Validation Proposal: Submit a proposal requesting that ApocalyseDAO validates a world event as "apocalyptic" by upvoting the proposal. If an event is validated, then members can make claims on ApocalypseDAO for support and coverage in mitigating the effects of the event.

Apocalypse Coverage Proposal: If you feel you have been impacted by an apocalyptic event, make a coverage proposal explaining your situation.

Meta Proposal: If you would like to change ApocalypseDAO in some way, or make a proposal that isn't encompassed in current existing proposal types, make a meta proposal.
