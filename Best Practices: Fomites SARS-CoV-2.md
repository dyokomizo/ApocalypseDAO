BEGIN

## Explain Like I‚Äôm Five (skip ahead for details)

‚ÄúThe CoronaVirus‚Äù that everyone is talking about is called ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2‚Äù by scientists. Scientists barely know anything about SARS-CoV-2, so it is best to be very careful given this uncertainty, especially as many people have already died from SARS-CoV-2. ‚ÄúFomites‚Äù are objects that have SARS-CoV-2 on them and can infect you with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can survive on fomites, which include walls and floors, and particularly plastic, glass, and metal things (‚Äúnon-porous‚Äù objects, things without holes in them). There is some evidence indicating that fomites are transmitting SARS-CoV-2, but we are not totally sure, so we SHOULD act as if they are. If so, fomites can infect you even if the person that SARS-CoV-2 came from is long gone, nowhere in sight. You should expect that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on fomites for at least 7 days, but maybe even longer. Unlike other viruses, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 can even survive on cardboard (a porous material) much longer than normal. This is very scary. Even scarier, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 can travel long distances through the air (what we call ‚Äúairborne‚Äù) and land on objects, creating fomites! If you live in an apartment with shared air vents, you should seal your vents with plastic! In general, the best thing to do is try to never touch anything that ever COULD have had the virus on it, but if this is not possible, then wait for AT LEAST 7 days, and/or learn how to decontaminate the fomites, and wear very secure PPE (gloves, mask, etc.). It also seems likely that sunlight may help decontaminate fomites (because sunlight contains something called UV), so if you must touch a fomite, it is better if it has been in sunlight. Importantly, it seems that the warmth of the sunlight is not what helps, but the heat, where we have found that boiling temperatures are required to kill the virus (much higher than the temperature of sunlight on earth). Again, try to never touch anything unless absolutely necessary, unless it is inside your home, and you know your home is virus free.

## Applications
Should you be worried about SARS-CoV-2 transmission by surfaces and fomites? Assuming inside your home is a ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù (no SARS-CoV-2 present), some examples of potential fomite transmission are:

- Receiving packages from the internet
- Food, beverages, and packaging (from a grocery story and/or home delivered)
- A pet (dog, cat, etc.) carrying SARS-CoV-2 into your home
- Clothing, hair, shoes, etc., carrying SARS-CoV-2 into your home
- Touching infected surfaces while outside and then touching yourself (mucous membrane)

## Objective

Developing best practices for avoiding contact with fomites and, when not avoidable, applying ‚Äú6-log reduction‚Äù decontamination to fomites (99.9999%).

## Systematic Review

### Methodology

For the sake of quickly developing a first iteration of fomite best practices, this systematic review is relatively biased (not perfectly systematic, but a ‚Äúnarrative review‚Äù), with the following literature ‚Äúdiscovery biases‚Äù:

- ResearchGate: ResearchGate.net COVID19 Community ‚Äúfomites‚Äù search (using the ‚ÄúMost Recommended All Time‚Äù search function, a potentially biased algorithm). Selecting articles that seem high quality based on my subjective impressions. April 23, 2020.
- Twitter: Twitter search for ‚Äúfomites SARS-CoV-2‚Äù from personal twitter profile on (potential bias depending on Twitter‚Äôs black box recommendation algorithm). Selecting articles that seem high quality based on my subjective impressions. April 23, 2020.
- Google: Googling ‚Äúhow long does SARS-CoV-2 survive on surfaces‚Äù from my Google Chrome profile (potential bias depending on Google‚Äôs black box recommendation algorithm based on my Google Chrome profile). Selecting articles that seem high quality based on my subjective impressions. April 23, 2020.
- Random: Following leads or authors that are found in the above searches, again selecting articles that seem high quality based on my subjective impressions. April 23, 2020.

   - Key Finding: SARS-CoV-2 was found to survive on a surface for at least 17 days, but it‚Äôs unknown whether the virus was still viable. ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures had been conducted (Takuya Yamagishi, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2020). Although these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces, further study of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard cruise ships is warranted.‚Äù

## Further Research

- What constitutes an infective unit of SARS-CoV-2? Number of particles?
- Impact of environmental conditions on fomite transmission?
- Best practices of fomite decontamination, decontamination of PPE in particular (UV light, chemicals, heat, etc.).
- Compare SARS-CoV-2 fomite transmission to other coronaviruses. See if there is uniformity in fomite transmissibility amongst other coronaviruses, and if SARS-CoV-2 is an outlier.
- Can the virus be transmitted through mucous membranes, or open wounds? Or only through the respiratory system?
- Come up with a meta-analysis of the literature, maybe weight findings of each study based on the author‚Äôs ResearchGate score?
- Develop detailed best practices based on different fomite types (copper, aluminum, plastics, etc.).

## Accounting

It took about 8 hours of work to create this document, including conceptualization of the best practices format, searching for and reading literature, and completing this write-up. Requesting 200 APOC tokens for this, with the understanding that if this request is either too small or too large, it could be retroactively settled at a later point by some TBD method. For the record, I'm basing my 200 APOC request off of [this previous request](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x29c8cb20f7c2eaa6dfb6f5a363fcee3a3863f8f7a5b8b50f77c33148e75f4f19) for 100 APOC, which I think is a greatly undervalued benchmark. And to be clear, this best practice document is target to the validated apocalyptic event, "[The 2020 Pandemic](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x9a5258f279833f8d9b7c38b7e49dc9524b80daebf0a36710742d8a5b1587a792)".

DISCLAIMER: I‚Äôm not a medical professional and this isn‚Äôt medical advice. Take everything proposed here with a grain of salt. Also, this is a first iteration on best practices, and a proof-of-concept proposal for ApocalypseDAO, yet further reason to take this document with a grain of salt.
