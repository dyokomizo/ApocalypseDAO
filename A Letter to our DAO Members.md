# A Letter to our DAO Members[ðŸ”—](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x9a5258f279833f8d9b7c38b7e49dc9524b80daebf0a36710742d8a5b1587a792)

We need ApocalypseDAO Now.

Do we need reponomics? Yes.
Do we need tokenomics? Yes.
Do we need rep-tokenomics? Yes.
Do we need a "game ontology"? Yes.
Do we need proposals written in well-styled Markdown? Yes.

But first we need to get the ball rolling, break the ice. Let's not underestimate the value of precedent, nor the value of retroactively ascribing value according to The Spirit of The DAO.

The Spirit? The Spirit is that all ApocalypseDAO Members survive The Apocalypse (survive = not die). Our working hypothesis is that some form of Mutual Insurance a la DAO will be crucial to delivering on The Spirit. This can, and should, be formulated as Mission, Objectives, Goals, Metrics, when the time is right (not just my flimsy "Spirit" handwaving).

The Apocalypse is a continuous event-driven process. We have our first "validated event", The 2020 Pandemic. "Claims" (i.e. insurance claims) are allowed on "validated events". Second-order events will likely be triggered by The 2020 Pandemic event; there's more to come. Yes, this is a rough draft game ontology, a just-barely-in-time minimum viable DAO.

I'm largely writing this because I urgently want to submit best practices to surviving The 2020 Pandemic (e.g. face mask best practices), and to use ApocalypseDAO as an on-chain peer review mechanism. I also want to reward people for contributions ... but with what? APOC Token? REP? Clearly almost everything is to be determined.

To kick things off on-chain, I propose:
UPVOTE this proposal to validate that The 2020 Pandemic is an apocalyptic event.
UPVOTE to signal that each current member of ApocalypseDAO can request 1 APOC just for being a member.
UPVOTE that I can receive 1 APOC for writing this letter.
UPVOTE to signal a call for proposals on best practices, claims, validated events, or meta proposals (with corresponding and to be determined APOC and/or REPonomics).

I am requesting 2 APOC token in this proposal, 1 for being a member, 1 for writing this proposal, "A Letter to our DAO Members".

Best to all.
