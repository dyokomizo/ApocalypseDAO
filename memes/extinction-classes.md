# Extinction classes

Extinction is usually reserved for whole species, at least, or for the entire life on Earth. But thinking about extinction as a scale is also useful.

[Existential risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk) are a class of risks that endanger the future of humanity as a whole.

Mixing those two concepts and we can classify extinction events in two dimensions: scale and depth.

The scale of an extinction event is how much does it spread: personal, local, or global.

The depth of an extinction event is how deeply it causes harm: soft or hard. The deeper the harm the lesser are the chances of a successful recovery.

Examples of extinction events:
```
           soft                 hard
personal   addiction            death
   local   civil war            genocide
  global   worldwide dystopia   human species extinction
```

Soft extinction risks are an interesting category because they include "bad ending" scenarios that inhibit progress, possibly permanently, but usually aren't thought as huge risks. Inasmuch as they can be escaped they aren't as bad as hard extinction events, but without outside assistance those events can persist for very long time frames.

Other examples of soft extinction risks:
- personal: untreated mental illnesses, joining a cult.
- local: [poverty traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_trap), infrastructure collapse from extreme climate events.
- global: ecosystem collapse (forcing humanity to go back to early civilization population numbers).

Both dimensions are finer grained, those specific labels are useful for illustration but not for completeness.

BlackSwanDAO offers insurance against extinction events, to cover specific types of claims. This classification is useful to visualize what's the problem space we're worried about.
