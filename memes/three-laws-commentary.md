# Commentary on "[The Three Laws of BlackSwanDAO](three-laws.md)"

## **First Law**
> *BlackSwanDAO* may not increase the risks of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) or, through gross negligence, allow such risks to increase.

[Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) are, by definition, "hard-to-predict and rare", but accepting that we have little power to affect their odds of happening doesn't imply we should neglect their [management](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248). In particular, BlackSwanDAO raison d'être is having response plans in place for [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

> Worry according to the probability.
>
> Plan according to the expected value.

## **Second Law**
> *BlackSwanDAO* may not harm its [members](../notes/membership.md) or, through gross negligence, allow its [members](../notes/membership.md) to come to harm except when it would conflict with the **First Law**.

Not only through the services it offers and the products it sells, but through the commitment of its [community](../notes/membership.md), BlackSwanDAO does what's necessary to keep its [members](../notes/membership.md) unharmed.

For example, let's say some of its [members](../notes/membership.md) are climate change denialists of various kinds and the routinely downplay the odds and impacts of extreme climate events. This denialism biases BlackSwanDAO towards charging lower premiums for insurance products related to extreme climate events and to not fulfilling such claims. The **Second Law** states that such denialism is against BlackSwanDAO essence and are unacceptable, it's not merely a "political opinion" or a "scientific disagreement". Similarly, BlackSwamDAO [members](../notes/membership.md) are harmed if our collective beliefs regarding climate change are more alarmist and extremist than it's reasonable given the evidence, as this position also harms our [members](../notes/membership.md) by charging higher premiums than its warranted.

[Correct beliefs matter!](https://twitter.com/dyokomizo/status/1271805137200320513)

The **Second Law** doesn't force the [members](../notes/membership.md) to do specific actions outside BlackSwanDAO, but it forces them to not let harmful beliefs impact our risk management, for example. A denialist [members](../notes/membership.md) can spread misinformation under their own identity, but as soon as they use or become publicly entangled with BlackSwanDAO then we can moderate their speech under threat of termination (e.g. full [名 slash](../notes/reputation.md), but [石](../notes/koku.md) is inviolable).

On the other hand, if BlackSwanDAO evaluates a candidate vaccine/medicine for a pandemic, conclude it's a scam and not worth stashing it, and then later it figures out it was wrong, that's ok. It's not gross negligence, it did due dilligence.

## **Third Law**
> *BlackSwanDAO* must enable the flourishing of its [members](../notes/membership.md), except when it would conflict with the **First** or **Second Law**.

For all intents and purposes, except when they fall under the three laws, BlackSwanDAO is neutral. It must not negatively interfere with its [members](../notes/membership.md) affairs. Some [members](../notes/membership.md) may hold opposing political or religious beliefs, may even be viewed as criminals in each other's eyes (e.g. BlackSwanDAO has [members](../notes/membership.md) accross jurisdictions, some [members](../notes/membership.md) may think acts legal in other jurisdictions are atrocious).

BlackSwanDAO is united against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). Nothing more and nothing less.

This means that it is interested in the flourishing of all of its [members](../notes/membership.md), because every well-functioning [members](../notes/membership.md) is an irreplaceable asset for the most critical problem BlackSwanDAO faces: risk management.

[Members](../notes/membership.md) that are worried about trying to make ends meet, surviving avoidable situations (e.g. escaping civil wars), etc., are [members](../notes/membership.md) that have less time and incentives to help BlackSwanDAO manage risk.

As long as BlackSwanDAO is solvent, it's in its best interests that all of its [members](../notes/membership.md) have more time available to further improve its own solvency.

If the focus on continuity for all [members](../notes/membership.md) is preserved, even it means fulfilling claims that are objectionable by individual [members](../notes/membership.md), BlackSwanDAO will maximize the odds of achieving its goals: it'll have no internal conflict of interest and will be more predictable to outsiders, an incentive to more effective cooperation along our own goals and other [instrumental convergent goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence).
