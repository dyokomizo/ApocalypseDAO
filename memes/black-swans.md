## Understanding Black Swans

[Black swan events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) (aka black swans) are, by definition, hard to predict and unexpected: their properties and consequences are outside the expectations and capabilities of existing institutions and systems, otherwise they wouldn't be black swans.

The disruption caused by such events breaks the assumptions we use to design and assess the robustness of our systems. They are the blind spots in the perspective promoted by status quo, the chinks in the armors built with our existing paradigms. It's meaningless to expect existing best practices to be sufficient in the face of black swans.

Black swans can be understood as unforeseen [regime shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_shift), sometimes a [critical transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_transition) is associated with the shift. Under this perspective, black swans have a disruption period until the new regime stabilizes.

During the disruption period the old status quo is no longer in control, its assumptions are violated, but the new status quo still isn't available to be exploited. BlackSwanDAO's [mutual savings bank for 石 (koku)](../notes/bank.md#liability-is-as-continuous-as-black-swan-events) [hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) to prevent wealth loss during the disruption period and also exploits [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) opportunities after the new status quo emerges.

## Maximizing Continuity Against the Unforeseeable

The [石 bank](../notes/bank.md#liability-is-as-continuous-as-black-swan-events) an institution that offer robust protections against indirect effects of black swans for the entire BlackSwanDAO and, therefore, all of its [members](../notes/membership.md), but it offers little protection against direct effects for individual members.

Direct effects can have a huge impact, as described in the [extinction classes analysis](../memes/extinction-classes.md), and the affected members may not be able to benefit from actual claims afterwards.

As the effects of black swans are both disproportional and asymmetric, a [mutual insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_insurance) approach is beneficial to spread the impact of the risks across all [members](../notes/membership.md). Not only the insured [members](../notes/membership.md) are benefited by such insurance contracts, but BlackSwanDAO as a whole benefits, because without [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder) it can't exist and effective [shareholders](../notes/membership.md#shareholder) and [stateholders](../notes/membership.md#stateholder) are crucial to its continued existence.

In the face of black swans all assumptions are off, but bets increase ten-fold in importance.

Traditional assumptions about risk-averse assets fails in the face of black swans: there are no longer safe assets. During the disruption period and after the new status quo emerges the risk profile of different assets may change drastically and previously risk-averse positions may have bankrupted entirely.

[Arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) during the disruption period is tricky, because what is valuable during the disruption period may no longer be valuable under the new status quo. It's possible to make bets and try to acquire assets that lose most of their value in the hope that they'll regain some value after the disrupton period ends. Such bets may be necessary to improve the odds of future continuity, but they [reallocate the assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) and that brings its own costs and risks.

## Black Swan are Discontinuous in the Long Term Scale

Black swans are continuous in the short term scale: as we watch the events unfolding we can see how all the moving pieces fit in the whole mechanism and, eventually, we can understand how it was all obvious in retrospect. Sadly, this newly gained understanding is incorrect, much more often than not.

In the long term scale, which is the only term that matters for BlackSwanDAO's strategy, black swans are discontinuous: until they happen status quo rules, after they happen there's disruption, and a new status quo eventually emerges.

From that perspective black swans are discontinuous in both time and space. Even in a global economy most unforeseen events have different impacts at different locations and have different failures that take time to happen, propagate, and cause damage. It's possible to arbitrage the risk differential and fulfill the claims of its [members](../notes/membership.md) in order to maximize its own solvency at all times.
