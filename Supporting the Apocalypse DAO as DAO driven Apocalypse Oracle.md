# Supporting the Apocalypse DAO as DAO driven Apocalypse Oracle[ðŸ”—](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0xbc19a4f08e87ce86b411180bf817ff247c5ae05e4faded3e1e7abfc9b0d863d7)

I support the following elements from the [original Apocalypse DAO proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x9a5258f279833f8d9b7c38b7e49dc9524b80daebf0a36710742d8a5b1587a792)

> UPVOTE this proposal to validate that The 2020 Pandemic is an apocalyptic event.

> UPVOTE to signal that each current member of ApocalypseDAO can request 1 APOC just for being a member.

> UPVOTE that I can receive 1 APOC for writing this letter.

> UPVOTE to signal a call for proposals on best practices, claims, validated events, or meta proposals (with corresponding and to be determined APOC and/or REPonomics).

I propose we develop an "Apocalyptic Event" scale and definition:

Global or local?
- Physical life threatening (coronas) or digital life threatening (e.g. censorship)
- Species threatening (AIDS) or multi species/organism threatening (e.g. global warming)

etc.
