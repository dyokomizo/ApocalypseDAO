# ApoDAO Human Mission & Minimum Viable Ontology[🔗](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x29c8cb20f7c2eaa6dfb6f5a363fcee3a3863f8f7a5b8b50f77c33148e75f4f19)

Writing as ApocalypseDAO co-founder in service of #GSD #gettingshitdone and moving forward according to a clear agenda and mission, this proposal is intended to generally complement and be compatible with the current README, https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0xf5a905711109b6fb542a5b794ce4e99f05eb042a5ef1d96132c83098b03be28e
with one exception referenced below in regard to the “Validation of an Apocalypse”.

Thus this can be considered a Meta Proposal indicating adjustment of the README.

I propose that the human version of the stated mission of ApocalypseDAO (in the README, “Apocalypse Risk Management through Mutual Insurance”) is simply:
->> proactively attempting - by any #GSD means necessary - to reduce suffering and save lives, at scale.  Beyond this, we maintain commitment to serving our members first, and subsequently as we’re able to replicate our model and scale we could then address supporting external communities.

Among the proposal types listed, to me this one is lacking context and needs to be updated:
“Apocalypse Validation Proposal: Submit a proposal requesting that ApocalyseDAO validates a world event as "apocalyptic" by upvoting the proposal. If an event is validated, then members can make claims on ApocalypseDAO for support and coverage in mitigating the effects of the event.”

Now we face critical steps in designing and launching this new container, mechanism, system, to achieve some things.
We need to identify the playing field, objectives and priorities. In this sense it’s good/ useful/ important to validate, and to identify/ gather a comprehensive-enough functional (minimum viable) collection of such validations. However before such valuation is identified/ established/ agreed among our group - this “validation” seems backwards and in the case of Daniel’s proposal
https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x16324a63bac8f6ca2b960064efe4e2873921eab93322b15a615293c3e5e990e0 
 to reward simply for flagging an event of “apocalypse-proportion crisis” before these terms have clear meaning I feel is out of order. 

Thus I downvoted as a way to propel our discourse and proactive collaborative design focus, and aim for a more structured operational flow of #GSD. I welcome and will gladly upvote future validation proposals once we’ve discussed further and established context and definitions.

Truthfully I’m glad Daniel’s proposal passed as he appears to have acted in good faith according to the README, thereby bringing us closer to a meaningful sense of “validation”. This concept is integral as we put the system together on the ground level.

Without first deciding together what exactly this means for us, it reduces to barely more than “flagging” in lieu of defining any definition/ metrics of “apocalypse” (or validation thereof) whatsoever beyond someone’s vague claim. We’ve yet to define our terms!

The task/ set of tasks involved in assembling a reasonably functional (I suggest functionality and interoperability remain guiding principles/ modus operandi) ‘working list’ of such “verified apocalyptic instances” could become exhaustive and sprawling as such events escalate, compound and cascade exponentially, trashing all boundaries, borders, possibility to delineate between or isolate “individual apocalypses”  … and so our viewfinder must give us a sharp view to the target (not necessarily a single “event” or “circumstance” but something much more
dynamic and systemic, at the same time much more specific e.g. to human interventions hyperlocally/ regionally) so we do not waste ammo with buckshot.

As a precursor to becoming operational, a useful exercise would be to start creating “a historical review of what would be considered i.e., at that time, in that place, in those terms of expression and understanding an apocalyptic event throughout history, to create precedent, to have some consensus for making decisions in the future.” (Aaron)

Then, we can assemble these findings and understandings to construct a reasonably clear composite definition of “Apocalypse Now” and the barely foreseeable future.

In creating our list of “verified apocalyptic events” - or rather episodes/ situations/ circumstances/ sieges (?! “verified apocalyptic situational trauma” or VAST) “ - we also need to establish many things; so let’s co-create a list of “validated list criteria”, i.e., what are the most essential tasks, issues, challenges, aspects of our mission etc. which need doing most immediately? And then according to consensus “validate” these items in subsequent updates to the README. We need this list and it will be iterative

Takeaway: 

Let’s step slightly back for an overview so we can move forward on a clear, coherent and holistic track.

Solution #1:

“Minimum Viable Ontology” #MVO
Create and continually update collaboratively our “list of lists” of what we need to do/ have/ discover/ research/ define to take the next immediate urgent steps. We must approach this by indicating clear enough contexts - i.e. explanatory, comprehensive, careful language indicating parameters and metrics (either clearly enough understood/established or to be determined/ established) - for any given moment, proposal, conversation, organizational development need, and especially priority VAST-based crises.

In other words:

We must - first before anything else - define our terms !!

Peace, CB
