# ApocalypseDAO Friends and Family "Round"[ðŸ”—](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0xe5db071e16008fc245ab3057791144053bb02ad94ae6d4493892fe1fe4bc6368)

NOTE: ApocalypseDAO is not creating an equity/stock in issuing its APOC token. APOC it a utility token.

If you are reading this, you have probably been invited to join the ApocalypseDAO "Friends and Family 'Round'".

This round will be open until May 1, 2020, 12:00 CET.

We are issuing both REP and APOC token in this round.

Denomination: Buy-in is denominated in rough rice. This round has a minimum buy-in of 100 pounds of rough rice, and a maximum buy-in of 10,000 pounds of rough rice. The buy-in cost is updated live based on the value of rough rice per the [Rough Rice Futures Contract (RR)](https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice). Buy-in can be done with up to 4 tranches totalling up to 10,000 pounds of rough rice (e.g. April 15th buy-in 2,500 pounds of rough rice, April 20th buy-in 2,500 pounds of rough rice, etc.). Buy-in currencies allowed are ETH** and/or GEN* tokens. As prices are volatile and cryptocurrency transfers can be slow to process, ApocalypseDAO will allow up to a 1% gap between buy-in value and crypto value at the time of receipt.

APOC Offering: 1 pound of rough rice = 1 APOC token.[ðŸ”—](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x7cb904fb2e2942122e28be1fbebf40b2653f8c2ac51630a37e739c8631389e7c)

REP Offering: REP is not buyable, therefore the amount of REP you will be issued is not based on your rough rice contribution, but on the level of trust current ApocalypseDAO members have in you. There are 3 levels of REP that members can be initialized with, by vote of current REP holders (we recommend you discuss with [current REP holders](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/members/) before requesting REP).

Creator: 10,000 REP
Contributor: 1,000 REP
Lurker: 100 REP

\*GEN is a volatile, low-volume token. ApocalypseDAO will use the 30-day closing average as the price of GEN, to deter manipulation, based on [Messari's price history](https://messari.io/asset/daostack/historical).

\**ApocalypseDAO should use the [CoinbasePro ETH/USD price feed](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ETH-USD).[ðŸ”—](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x44d55a8492a90640dc6af013657eaf1ac5bc9548/proposal/0x7cb904fb2e2942122e28be1fbebf40b2653f8c2ac51630a37e739c8631389e7c)
