# BlackSwanDAO

> deceleration towards extinction

----

BlackSwanDAO is a [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) for continuity in the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

## Mission

Improving the odds of its [members'](membership.md) continued existence by [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) using [mutual organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_organization).

## Problem

[Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) are, by definition, hard to predict and unexpected: their properties and consequences are outside the expectations and capabilities of existing institutions and systems, otherwise they wouldn't be [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

## Solution

BlackSwanDAO offers systems and institutions to distribute risk impact throughout space and time: through [mutual insurance](insurance.md) and [mutual banking](bank.md) its [members](membership.md) pool together assets that are allocated in a [portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) to insure against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). As its members are distributed in space and (not all) [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) happen at the same time and with the same outcome in different places, it's possible to arbitrage the risk differential and fulfill the claims of its [members](../notes/membership.md) in order to maximize its own solvency at all times.

## Design

New and old members submit "deed" proposals with the terms of contract they want to acquire. The proposal is reviewed and approved or rejected by [voting](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-privilege-of-the-individual). The governance process is updated in a similar manner. Proposals that grant [石 (koku) tokens](bank.md) will start the minting process new tokens and they'll be delivered to the address registered in the proposal. The [metagovernance document](meta.md) describes the process in more details.
