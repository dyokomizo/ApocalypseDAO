# Membership: Privileges and Responsibilities

> unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno

----

BlackSwanDAO is a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) for [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). As any organization it has members, but member is a word that brings very little meaning to the conversation.

A member is part of the organization, but that says nothing about the roles such an actor may play. The definition of the roles a member may play are crucial to understand how the interactions between the members of an organization play out and what are the societal norms involved.

At BlackSwanDAO we recognize four distinct roles that its members can play at any given time. Those aren't permanent and mutually exclusive, it's expected that members play different roles at different moments in time, in accord to their expectations and the organization's situation.

Inasmuch as newcomers have the same privileges and responsibilities as already existing members, it's understood they don't have the effective tacit knowledge to interact with the community and to leverage BlackSwanDAO services: two already existing members act as their sponsors. These sponsors are co-responsible for the sponsored actions and decisions as they are related to BlackSwanDAO, especially in situations that result in loss of assets for the newcomer. Sponsors are lines of cultural transmission and it's through them that newcomers can become effective members. Each individual sponsor must hold more [石 (koku)](koku.md) and [名 (na/mei)](reputation.md) than the newcomer, so that all have sufficient and appropriate "skin in the game".

Sponsorship becomes mentorship becomes partnership, but it never ends. To foster engagement and accountability within BlackSwanDAO these closer partnership bounds are necessary.

## Stakeholder

> stake·hold·er
>
> noun ― a person with an interest or concern in something, especially a business.

> In a corporation, a stakeholder is a member of "groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist", as defined in the first usage of the word in a 1963 internal memorandum at the Stanford Research Institute.

BlackSwanDAO exists to improve the odds of its members' continued existence, as long as those members exist BlackSwanDAO has a purpose. Stakeholders are the members that give support to BlackSwanDAO's own continuity. Mutual support is the foundation upon which BlackSwanDAO rests.

In concrete terms, stakeholders contribute their assets to the [portfolio managed](bank.md) by BlackSwanDAO, by the acquisition of services. Those services are claimable liabilities that can be fulfilled in the future (if the claim conditions are met). Through those assets BlackSwanDAO has the leverage to increase the odds of continued existence for its members and through the acquisition of services the stakeholders have concrete means of increasing those odds.

Other members continued existence are also part of BlackSwanDAO's purpose, but without the acquisition of specific services BlackSwanDAO is limited in its capabilities: it's harder to assess the probability and impact of risks if there's no concrete service associated with them.

[Banking](bank.md) is the most fundamental service that BlackSwanDAO offers, upon which all other services are supported. It's also an indefinite service, the stakeholder can hold on [石](koku.md) for as long as they want. Other services, such as [insurance](insurance.md) are more finite in temporal scope and for that reason a stakeholder can lose this status after the expiration of the last service they acquired.

[石高 (kokudaka)](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) is the primary means of assessing the wealth and solvency of BlackSwanDAO, it's also in every stakeholder's best interests to improve BlackSwanDAO's [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth).

Stakeholders must always keep in mind that BlackSwanDAO is an self-regulated organization: there's no higher authority to prevent or repair mistakes and/or fraud. Engagement and vigilance are necessary to increase the odds of solvency.

## Shareholder

> share·hold·er
>
> noun ― an owner of shares in a company.

> A shareholder is an individual or institution that legally owns one or more shares of stock in a public or private corporation.

― [Shareholder, on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder)

In traditional organizations the concept of ownership is usually intertwined with the concept of authority. DAOs try to separate these in token and reputation ownership. At BlackSwanDAO [名 is a measure of reputation](reputation.md).

Shareholders hold BlackSwanDAO's [名](reputation.md). and act as the official, and sometimes also public, face of the organization.

The primary responsibility of a shareholder is steering BlackSwanDAO towards a better future. For example, by [managing the portfolio](bank.md) of assets held by BlackSwanDAO to increase its [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth).

Another way shareholders steer BlackSwanDAO towards a better future is by designing services that can increase the odds of continued existence of its stakeholders: flourishing stakeholders are essential to further increase the prosperity of BlackSwanDAO.

Its expected of shareholders to have BlackSwanDAO's continuity behind all of their arguments and reasoning.

## Stageholder

> stage
>
> noun ― a point, period, or step in a process or development.
>
> noun ― a raised floor or platform, typically in a theater, on which actors, entertainers, or speakers perform.
>
> noun ― a scene of action or forum of debate, especially in a particular political context.

Organizations grow through assets and members, stakeholders and shareholders deal with the problem of fostering growth of assets, but stageholders are one of the primary forces behind increasing the number of members.

BlackSwanDAO's stage is its whole set of services and documents and history, that are presented to candidate members. It's like a theater's stage in which the stageholders perform to this audience of candidate members, promoting BlackSwanDAO and raising awareness. But, also like a step in a process, it's also the current stage of BlackSwanDAO progress and the stageholders, through their interface with the audience and outside world, can point out to possibilities of improvement and problems in the existing presentation. In this second sense the stageholders' audience is all of BlackSwanDAO's existing members.

One of the most popular forms of engagement practiced by stageholder is in sharing of recent developments through news articles. These are useful to inform shareholders and support them in their responsibilities.

Stageholders also act as the public face of BlackSwanDAO as they try to raise awareness about the organization. It's a role of utmost importance in this regard.

## Stateholder

> state
>
> noun ― the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time.

> noun ― the civil government of a country.

BlackSwanDAO can be understood as an [mutual insurance provider](insurance.md), by this lens the continuity of the organization lies on its capability to correctly assess risk.

If our services are overpriced we lose both new and old stakeholders, as fewer will acquire those services, but for existing stakeholders the failure is even greater because BlackSwanDAO failed to protected them from risk.

If our services are underpriced we decrease the odds of continued solvency, as we'll lose more often than we gain on those services. The entire organization will suffer.

Stateholders are responsible to "keep the records straight" and keep our "maps close to the territories." They hold [名](reputation.md), much like shareholders, and presumably lots of [石](koku.md), much like stakeholders. The incentives to keep both of those holdings can be explained by their perspective: deep and wide pragmatism, the ability to assess risks strategically and methodically.

New services proposed by shareholders are reviewed and vetoed by stateholders. Liabilities for existing stakeholders are reviewed by stateholders to verify that all assumptions are still held. Proposals for the acquisition of services by old or new stakeholders are evaluated by stateholders so they're correctly priced.

Stateholders primary responsibility is to ensure that we fail fast and softly, not late and catastrophically.
