## Location, Location, Location

The value of a house varies with the location in which it resides, but the value of a home is constant: priceless.

[石](koku.md#石-as-the-concrete-unit-of-life) can be seen as the concrete unit of life, but it's only the first unit of many. Food is the first resource any living being must secure in order to survive, but protection against the elements and other beings is fundamental to maximize the odds of continued existence.

All animals seek shelter for rest. Sometimes it's only temporary because transience and unpredictability is one of the most basic defense tactics. Sometimes it's persistent: effort and resources are invested to secure the shelter. This investment pays itself in the long run, by improving the odds of the run being long in the first place.

In the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) all assumptions are off, but bets increase ten-fold in importance.

The safest bet is betting that no place is safe, but some places are safer than others.

In order to improve the odds of solvency, BlackSwanDAO manages a [bank for 石](bank.md) that holds a [carefully allocated assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) to minimize the impact of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

Similarly, a portfolio of shelters in different locations across the globe can be used to [hedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) against the spatial impacts of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

## Evaporating the Timeshare's False Dilemma

> While timeshares can be an exciting and perhaps cost-effective way to travel on a regular basis, they often have both up-front and on-going costs that must be weighed.
>
> Timeshares should not be considered investments, since the vast majority of timeshare contracts lose value in the secondary market and they do not generate income for owners.

> every problem is a conflict, and that conflicts arise because we create them by believing at least one erroneous assumption. Thus, simply by thinking about the assumptions that enforce the existence of a conflict, we should be able to resolve any conflict by evaporating it with the power of our thinking.

― [Evaporating Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporating_Cloud)

Most finance analysts agree that timeshares are usually a waste of money. If we see a [timeshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeshare) as an investment or a savings cost device than this analysis is correct.

There's a different perspective that breaks those assumptions apart and illuminates how it a [timeshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeshare) can be used to reduce the impacts of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md): a timeshared shelter is an insurance against loss of residency.

If a timeshared shelter is neither an investment nor a vacation place but it's an insurance mechanism, then the assumptions change and it's no longer a comparison between staying in a hotel vs staying in a timeshare during a vacation, but having to scramble to find an impromptu shelter during an emergency vs having an emergency shelter prepared and a plan to go there.

## Home Insurance Is Where The Heart Insurance Is

> We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.

― [John Perry Barlow](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

Traditional home insurance policies cover the costs of losing a house to an accidents or damage caused by third parties. After claiming for the losses incurred and receiving the monetary compensation, the insured can repair/rebuild the house or buy a new one, depending on the situation. But there's an upfront cost in time until a house is available again. Also, this presupposes a loss of the house only.

How useful is the monetary compensation if the disruption caused by a [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md) makes it impossible to use the money? e.g.:

- Mass floods that destroy multiple houses at once in the same location (e.g. multiple blocks in a city) will drive the house prices as the [supply and demand curves change in the local housing market](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-housing-market.asp).
- Civil wars make the affected areas unsafe for living and, even if a similar house could be acquired, evacuation is a priority.

As usual with [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) the assumptions that make house insurance policies work break apart when the disruption period starts. We can no longer assume that we can afford the time until the house is available again or that the monetary compensation will be enough.

An oases portfolio, with multiple "oasis" shelters distributed across the globe [hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) against, at least, those two risks: the shelters are already available and far away from the disrupted location.

Travel to a shelter is not covered by oases, but is covered by usual BlackSwanDAO's [evacuation insurance policies](insurance.md#insurance-against-the-unthinkable-is-unconventional). With both services contracted a [stakeholder](membership.md#stakeholder) can simultaneouslu claim the evacuation policy and the oases "renting". BlackSwanDAO's [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) and [shareholders](membership.md#shareholder) can then assess the best evacuation plan and matching available shelter location.

Oases reduce the ruling our [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) must consent to the state over their bodies, at least by a small margin.

## Shelters as Shared Insurance Policies

Not all [members](membership.md) may want to have a stake in oases, after all [石](koku.md#石-as-the-foundational-unit-of-management) is BlackSwanDAO's foundational solution that enables further, more sophisticated and specialized, solutions.

The specific mechanics and legalities of the implementation of [timeshared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeshare) shelters may require incorporation or other forms of official partnerships that may also be undesirable by and/or unavailable for some [members](membership.md).

Those reasons establish the need for oases to not be an obligation of BlackSwanDAO as a whole, while it can offer its governance institutions to manage the claims and shelters availabilities, attest the reputation of participating [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) by [名 (na/mei)](reputation.md) arbitration (e.g. slash their [名](reputation.md) if a shelter was damaged during their stay and the fine wasn't paid).

On the other hand, there's no reason for the ownership of some of the shelters to not be part of its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), as long as the [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) and [shareholders](membership.md#shareholder) agree it's a good investment opportunity and appropriate rules of usage are defined.

## An Outline of Oases Organization

Shelters can exist in all shapes and forms, but the best ones are independent housing units that exist solely for the purpose of being shelters.

Physically, shelters must have a location to be built on and some form of administration is required to verify that it still functional.

The demand for shelters varies as [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) occur, we may imagine some metrics based on the number of [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) involved or the number of distinct locations they reside in, but all such metrics are just poor guesses for the unguessable. This would be a problem if shelters, like regular insurance policies, had no way to balance profits and costs other than adjust the policy price. Shelters can be rented for third-parties, e.g. through Airbnb, while they aren't being used. Obviously occupied shelters are unavailable for claims, which reduces their value when [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) happen, but limiting the fraction of shelters being rented and the rental period (e.g. having an interval between rentals, not renting for multiple consecutive weeks) and also accepting the fines from cancelling future rentals (i.e. giving preference to [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder)) are ways to reduce thoses risks. Renting is a way to reduce the total cost of ownership, but the primary value of shelters is an insurance mechanism: it's necessary to balance those, but never forget that the insurance comes first.

[Stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) that have large properties (e.g. farms) can have shelters built there. One example of such shelters is 20 square meters prefab cottages, a bedroom and a bathroom, that can be cheaply bought with a good quality. Individual [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) can buy and have them installed, and "enroll" them in the shelter roster. Their stake in the oases would be proportional to the number of shelter-units they enroll (e.g. bigger shelters may be worth more). Their share of the profits and claimable hours per month would also be proportionally bigger. Such shelters would be easier to administer since the [stakeholder](membership.md#stakeholder) lives nearby, which makes it a more favorable idea. Other [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) can also pool in their resources and buy such cottages and have them installed in yet another [stakeholder's](membership.md#stakeholder) property, in this scenario they all would contribute with a fraction of the shelters to the pool.
