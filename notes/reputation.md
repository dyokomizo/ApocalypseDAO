## 名 is not (only) About Reputation

In [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) there is a debate about governance: [Reputation vs Tokens](https://daotalk.org/t/reputation-vs-tokens/452). [Reputation (REP)](https://daotalk.org/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-rep-reputation/813/1) is a non-token asset that is used for voting.

BlackSwanDAO is a reputation-based governance organization, but as with the choice of new name, i.e. [石 (koku)](koku.md), to capture more deeply the meaning and nuance behind our views, we'll use 名 (na/mei) instead of reputation (REP).

First, it has the dennotation of reputation, but it also has the connotation of a reputation tied to an identity, as the same ideogram has a dennotation of name and is used in words related to personal and family names.

In a subtle but deep sense, 名 holders in BlackSwanDAO have both their personal identity and reputation reified in 名 but also are carriers of BlackSwanDAO's name/face and reputation, both internally and, to a smaller extent, externally.

## 名 is not a Reward on Its Own

A common view in reputation-based governance DAOs is that REP is its own reward and incentives must exist to engage members.

BlackSwanDAO is much more focused than other DAOs, with [石](koku.md) as the token that embodies the idea of continuity. A [shareholder](membership.md) that isn't also a [stakeholder](membership.md), of proportional holdings, is dangerous to BlackSwanDAO, because they don't have incentives aligned to BlackSwanDAO's.

[石高 (kokudaka)](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) is the primary reward, the increase of BlackSwanDAO's assets towards better odds of solvency in the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). Governance follows this principle and must not steer away from it.

## 名 is not an Incentive for Speculation

For other DAOs governance is an active process of creation of new proposals that don't always have a clear impact on its organization's own goals. Creation of proposals means movement and without movement the organization dies.

BlackSwanDAO is the opposite: the goal is to be conservative, both in proposals and risk. New proposals are for new services or for asset reallocations or for claim approval, all activities that affect solvency directly. At BlackSwanDAO proposals either clearly affect solvency in expected ways or unexpectedly will affect solvency in unclear ways.

The moment we need artificial incentives for engagement in proposals is the moment BlackSwanDAO failed in continuity, it'll be a straight line towards insolvency after that, just a matter of time.


## 名 is not a Privilege of the Individual

Voting is seen as a right in modern societies, having your choice realized is the goal in itself. Governance institutions that are based on voting offer little to no opportunities to assess if the winning vote correlated in any way to a more preferable future. Voting is its own reward: any vote is a good vote as long as you do the voting. The act of choosing is virtuous.

Yielding 名 in BlackSwanDAO is an entirely different matter. When presented with options A and B, a 名 holder has an objective criterion in mind: whether it increases [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) and, therefore, improves the odds of solvency or it decreases [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) and, therefore, diminishes the odds of solvency.

It's always possible to assess, after the fact, if the winning vote led to a more preferable future.

By design BlackSwanDAO governance is closer to a [futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html), a 名 holder votes as in a betting market: they use their knowledge and understanding of the world to predict what is the better outcome for BlackSwanDAO and votes accordingly. If they fail to do so they are acting against their best interests as they are decreasing BlackSwanDAO's odds of solvency and decreasing the value of their [石](koku.md) holdings.

Therefore, correct voting can and must be rewarded. Similarly incorrect voting can and must be punished. Both outcomes should lead to adjustments in 名 distribution.

Absent voting is usually incorrect voting, as it conveys zero information about expectations. In prediction markets absent votes only correlate with correct beliefs in events that have no better than chance odds, e.g. flipping a fair coin. Otherwise the absentee ballot is equivalent to always predicting an outcome with 50% odds but getting it right less than 50% of the time.

Making a proposal work much like votes and are affected by the same constraints and incentives. The mechanism for both is the same: making a proposal is voting for it.

Every proposal has a deadline upon which [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) will be compared against the last measured value before the proposal was made. 名 will be redistributed them, according to the outcome and the votings.

## 名 is not a Solution Looking for a Problem

Inasmuch as BlackSwanDAO is conservative, it requires minimum amounts of movement for continuity. At least the [asset portfolio allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) will need some readjustments, which is also done through the process of proposals and voting, as it requires the same kind of scrutiny and careful analysis.

名 yielders' incentives for correct predictions and rulings are three-fold:
1. They increase BlackSwanDAO's [石](koku.md) holdings and therefore improve their own odds of having the claims for their own benefits fulfilled, when they vote for a proposal and the outcome was beneficial.
2. They increase their own 名 holdings, even if the outcome of the proposal wasn't beneficial, as long as they vote in favor of proposals later assessed to be beneficial and vote against proposals later assessed to be maleficial.
3. They increase BlackSwanDAO's reputation and standing among other DAOs. Having a big 名 holding in a seemingly prosperous organization increases their prospects in other organizations and endeavors.

名 is a solution to a very simple problem: it's change or die. BlackSwanDAO continuity is not through stasis, but through careful but correct adaptation. As long as we focus on this single and unwinnable problem 名 will be the right solution.

> Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.
