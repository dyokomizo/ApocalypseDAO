# 石 (koku)

> virtual rice for real people

----

> The koku (石) is a Chinese-based Japanese unit of volume, 1 koku is equivalent to 10 to (斗) or approximately 180 litres (40 imp gal; 48 US gal), or about 5 bushels.
>
> As a rule of thumb, one koku was considered sufficient quantity of rice to feed one person for one year.
>
> A koku of brown rice (unpolished rice) weighs about 150 kilograms (330 lb).

## 石 as the Quintessential Unit of Continuity

[Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) are, by definition, hard to predict and unexpected: their properties and consequences are outside the expectations and capabilities of existing institutions and systems, otherwise they wouldn't be [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).

We can only trust in the most fundamental assumptions, i.e. physics and biology, when we prepare for continuity in the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). One of the most essential aspects of life is thermodynamics, the fact that our lives depend on energy for continued existence.

An energy-focused perspective to act as a guideline for all of our continuity efforts is an assumption that is robust against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md): no matter what happens we'll still need energy for continued existence.

Energy intake is the most basic need required for continued existence, but with guaranteed fuel the engine of human creativity can be yielded to procure and ensure the remaining needs.

Money can be understood as the transfer of the benefits of work across space and time. As one exchanges the benefits of their work for money, they can later acquire the equivalent benefits from the work of others, by exchanging back with them.

In the way that money facilitates such transfers through time, it can be seen as a battery for the benefits of work, which are useful to decouple supply and demand of all kinds of energy.

## 石 as the Symbolic Unit of Wealth

石 symbolizes this energy perspective with its historical and traditional usage. It was also a measure of wealth: [石高 (kokudaka)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokudaka) was the system used to measure the economic yield of the land for taxation purposes, but it also could was a direct measure of how much human life could be sustained by that wealth.

One 石 represents the commitment of BlackSwanDAO in providing for one of its [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder) the basic means of continued existence for one year. Nothing more and nothing less.

The [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) held by BlackSwanDAO have no inherent value in itselve, other than being a proxy for 石: the continued existence of its [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder). In different [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md) scenarios the [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) should be diverse enough to still be worth the amount of 石 entrusted by the [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder).

One way of pricing one 石 is through [rough rice futures contract](https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-contracts) (pricing in hundredweight, which equals to 100 lb or 30.3% of one 石). This is useful to anchor its value to a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) [guess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price#Market_price) of what would the necessary to hold in assets, i.e. USD, to cover some amount of 石 worth of liabilities assuming that we can exchange our assets by such contracts and exchange the contracts by actual rice.

"石高 as a measure of wealth" implied that the land was able to sustain that economic yield, both due to its natural qualities and the efforts and skills of the farmers. At BlackSwanDAO "石高 as a measure of wealth" implies the governance of the assets held by BlackSwanDAO to back the 石 are being effective enough to maximize the odds of such wealth being realized (i.e. exchanging 石 for 150kg of rice in the future). In other words 石高 is [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) and [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) is 石高.

石高 must be a measure robust enough against daily fluctuations in order to minimize noise and maximize the signal of trends.

## 石 as the Concrete Unit of Life

One 石 of brown rice [weighs about 150kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koku#cite_note-9).

100g of brown rice [provides about 367 kcal](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169703/nutrients).

Coincidentally, it's very close to the number of days (365.2425) in a year in the [gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). For simplicity of argument we can say that 100g of brown rice can offer us 1 kcal of energy per day for a year.

That means one 石 of brown rice gives us 1,500 times that amount for a year or 1,500 kcal of energy per day for 365 days. One 石 corresponds to 547,500 kcal or 2.29x10⁹ J. One 石 of brown rice is a calorie battery, storing enough calories to sustain one year of continued human existence.

Most dietary guidelines recommend a daily intake of more than 1,500 kcal, but this number is in the right ballpark for a basic estimate. Nobody would survive with a diet of brown rice alone, the purpose of the 石 is not to be nutritional advice, but to offer a perspective.

Roughly speaking one 石 is one year of continued existence: the most basic need guaranteed, enabling human creativity and ingenuity to take over and handle the remaining "details".

## 石 as the Foundational Unit of Management

Once we see continued existence through this energy lens we can [manage our risks](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) through careful [assets portfolio allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

For example, one thousand [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder) entrust BlackSwanDAO with a total of 10,000 石. The primary measuring criteria for the [assets portfolio allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) is how probable can it covers this 10,000 石 liability.

One way of measuring this probability is in terms of [systems availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation), for example BlackSwanDAO can fulfill 50% of its obligations (i.e. pay out 5,000 石) with 99% availability (i.e. at most 3.65 days per year it won't have assets with sufficient valuation to cover that liability).

If the 石 [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) is also flexible (e.g. most [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder) contracted for their 10 石 to be spread over ten years) then the availability metrics can take this into account and we can have different probabilities for different time horizons. With a [portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) of 石 liabilities with different liquidities we have more options to [allocate the assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

## 石 as the First Unit of Many

Continuity is the goal, but the specifics of what will continue and what it entails are not well known as of now.

石 is the first step in this journey, as BlackSwanDAO gains expertise and practice with using it to [manage risk](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) and understand more deeply this energy intake perspective it'll be able to discover and create new mechanisms to handle black swan events.
