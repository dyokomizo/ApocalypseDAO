## The 石 Is Not Enough

[石 (koku)](koku.md)  is [representative money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money), a fungible asset that has no intrinsic value. While it is backed by an [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) that is diversified enough to withstand multiple kinds of risks and [market volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), there's always the certainty that a [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md) will break these assumptions and, at least, its [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) will suffer.

Assets with intrinsic value have [infinite liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity), if we have the needs they're useful for. The generality of an asset's use depends on what kinds of needs it's useful for, e.g. food is more general of an asset than insulin. The scarcity of an asset depends on the scenario being analyzed: drinkable water and food aren't usually scarce, but they may be in some scenarios.

Trying to predict which [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) will affect the scarcity of assets and the generality of their uses is an exercise in thinking the unthinkable: the status quo will be disrupted.

Instead we can have a portfolio of intrinsically valuable assets stored across the world and have the means to distribute them (e.g. drones) to [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) with specific needs.

## Insure All the Assets

When we talk about home insurance against fires people think about insurance policies, but sprinklers and fire extinguishers are kinds of insurance: we pay for them with the intent of never using them, but as soon as the need arises their invaluable.

If an insurance provider offered an insurance policy against fires that payed the insured enough money for them to buy a fire extinguisher it would be entirely useless: the money can't be spent fast enough when you need to extinguish the fire immediately.

Assets that have fire extinguisher properties are excellent candidantes to be stored in a trove. As soon as you smell the smoke you're delighted to see the fire extinguisher.

Another category of assets that are good candidates to be stored in a trove are assets with intrinsic value that aren't as general as food, but have chances of high [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)) during the disruption period caused by black swans. For example, insulin has these properties, it's not as much a commodity as food and it depends on industries and supply lines that can be disrupted. Another example are candidate medications in a pandemic. It may be possible to legally acquire doses of the medication before the tests are completed, but after the successful one is verified it's not going to be possible to compete with the governments purchasing power that deplete its market reserves.

## Insurance for the Insured

As with [oases](oases.md), asset troves are an insurance mechanism that uses BlackSwanDAO's governance institutions to manage the assets trove: acquisition, storage, and distribution after claims approval.

The specific mechanics of how troves will work depend on the scenarios they're designed to mitigate and how such events will play out in practice. For now they're another instatiation of the mutual insurance concept but, instead of pooling money to mitigate the impact of risks, it's pooling assets with intrinsic value to mitigate the impact of risks.
