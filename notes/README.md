# BlackSwanDAO - Notes

A repository of drafts for proposals to change the rules governing BlackSwanDAO.

----

* [石 (koku)](koku.md): 石 as a symbol for an energy-focused perspective that enables [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md) resilience.
* [名 (na/mei)](reputation.md): 名 as a symbol to represent not only individual reputation, but its communal responsibilities.
* [Membership](membership.md): membership and roles at BlackSwanDAO, what are the societal norms that guide engagement.
* [Banking](bank.md): BlackSwanDAO as a [mutual savings bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_savings_bank) for 石.
* [Insurance](insurance.md): BlackSwanDAO as a [mutual insurance provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_insurance) against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md).
* [Oases](oases.md): 石 is a promise for the most basic need: food. Shelter is the next logical, and necessary, step.
* [Troves](troves.md): assets of intrinsic value have almost [infinite liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity), only transportation from our troves to our [member](membership.md) is required.
* [Metagovernance](meta.md): the institution for upgrading the governance of BlackSwanDAO.
