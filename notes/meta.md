# Metagovernance: Governance for Governing the Governance

> forks are always on the table

----

> \[Metagovernance\] has been defined as, interalia, the organization of self-organization, the regulation of self-regulation, the steering of self-steering, the structuring of the game-like interaction within governance networks, and interaction among actors to influence parameter changes to the overall system.

> On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change.

> In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.

## It's Governance All the Way Down

As a [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) BlackSwanDAO has to assume from the beginning that it is decentralized and autonomous. There's no centralized authority that controls the organization nor there's any superior organization that regulates it's governance.

The ideal for a [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) is to have all of its [governance on-chain](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/why-on-chain-governance-82ecf28f314c): it automates the governance, makes it auditable and reliable, and gives a precise (albeit [inaccurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification#Limitations)) definition and implementation of the governance system.

That's not feasible when the governance system still is under discussion. It also breaks down when there's disagreement, within the limits of the governance system, about how to progress.

Metagovernance is the acknowledgement that governance doesn't stop at the "bottom", that [rules and norms outside the organization (aka nomos or natural law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law,_Legislation_and_Liberty) ultimately govern its governance.

## Metagovernance: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fork

In open-source software one of the fundamental rights is [the freedom to fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)#Forking_of_free_and_open-source_software). There's debate if "[is forking good?](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/forking-good)" but that doesn't refute the fundamental idea that forks can't be forbidden and its implications are well-known:

> Participants in an open source project seek to avoid forking a project because forking divides resources: the people who were once all collaborating are now split into two groups.

— [Is forking good?](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/forking-good)

BlackSwanDAO has the same problem, but it's magnified because not only the people can be split, but assets can also end up being split. Inasmuch as the on-chain assets belong to BlackSwanDAO, there's on-chain [石 (koku) tokens](bank.md#tokens-as-proxies-for-market-prices) that are backed by those assets and also on-chain insurance policies for which BlackSwanDAO is liable. This liability isn't enforced by any authority, but [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) live and die by their reputation, how outsiders assess their trustability and capability. Some of the splitting [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) may flood the market with [石 tokens](bank.md#tokens-as-proxies-for-market-prices) which will drive its price down and signal to the market that BlackSwanDAO odds of solvency worsened and it's [石高 (kokudaka)](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) lowered. BlackSwanDAO can buy back those [石 tokens](bank.md#tokens-as-proxies-for-market-prices) but it'll lose assets in the process.

> deceleration towards ~~extinction~~forking

A fork is unavoidable, but BlackSwanDAO specializes in continuity.

## Mutual Assured Continuity

Forks are costly both in time and in assets. BlackSwanDAO measures its solvency in [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth), this cost in assets is a reduction in its odds of continuity. BlackSwanDAO's continuity reflects on its [members continuity](membership.md) and vice-versa.

BlackSwanDAO success depends on adhering to the doctrine of "mutual assured continuity" (in contrast with the military doctrine of [mutual assured destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction)): both BlackSwanDAO and its members have incentives in improving each other's odds of continued existence. That includes all splitting members.

This doctrine provides incentives against forking and the resolution of conflicts that eventually would lead to forks.

In the "real world" there's a concept related to forks called ["voting with your feet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_voting), with similar mechanism and consequences.

## Governance without Consensus

[DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) are usually [governed by consensus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-1-116a73ba1e1c). Consensus, regular or holographic, is seen to be necessary because, while [on-chain governance](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/why-on-chain-governance-82ecf28f314c) provides (some) precise definitions, the DAOs itself are meaningless: there's no definition of its goals and purposes, there's no way to assess if it's successful, other than subjective evaluations and proxy metrics like userbase, growth or activity.

BlackSwanDAO is different it's goal is simple:

> deceleration towards extinction

It works towards this goal through [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) as a solvency measure to assess the odds of it fulfilling its liabilities towards its [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder).

It uses [名 (na/mei)](reputation.md) to measure its [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) and [shareholders](membership.md#shareholder) governance skills by [how well their beliefs](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-privilege-of-the-individual) on which proposals, be about governance or specific claims, will increase its [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) correlate with the actual consequences.

BlackSwanDAO governance is closer to a [futarchy](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html): "vote on values, but bet on beliefs.”

At BlackSwanDAO [名 (na/mei)](reputation.md) is the measure of voting power and [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) are rewarded [by voting correctly](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-privilege-of-the-individual). Votes are predictions.

There's no need to give incentives for voting, not voting is a prediction by itself: it's a prediction that the predictor is clueless about the future and has no beliefs in either way. This type of prediction is expected to be negatively rewarded, because only when every proposal has 1:1 odds of succeeding is meaningful to cast such votes.

Therefore every proposal has a collective, aggregated, prediction attached to it, be it a passing or a failing proposal. Even failed proposals affect the [名](reputation.md) distribution upon its original deadline: if a proposal was rejected and [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) decreased then those that cast the voted for rejection made predictions that harmed BlackSwanDAO's solvency.

## Learn Governance DAO-san... On-chain... Off-chain...

BlackSwanDAO uses two "chains", for now: on Ethereum's blockchain through DAOstack and on Git's internal merkle-tree through Github. Git commit hashes are cryptographic proof that the hash matches the content on the tree.

The git repository is the source of truth, for now, for all governance documents. Eventually whatever is possible to implement on-chain will be implemented. The current governance process is:

1. The mainstream repository on Github must be forked.
2. Proposals are drafted in the fork. Completed drafts are added to the "notes" top-level folder.
3. A pull request with the proposal is submitted, reviewed for security and legal issues, and merged.
4. The proposal is now public as a note and available for community review through several off-chain channels.
5. After debate it's edited on the fork, it's pull requested (still as a note), reviewed for security and legal issues, and merged.
6. After merged it's edited on the fork, moved to the "rules" top-level folder, and pull requested. Propaganda and educational are moved to the "memes" top-level folder. Contracts related to services and produts are moved to the "deeds" top-level folder.
7. Votes are cast, when the voting window closes the pull request is either merged if most votes cast are favorable, rejected otherwise.
8. On every successful merge, the HEAD hash (as [a transaction's data payload](https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-data-payloads-in-ethereum-transactions-354dbe995371)) is pushed to Ethereum. The hash payload is a [claim check](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/StoreInLibrary.html).
