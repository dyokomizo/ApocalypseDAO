## Insurance as a Hedge Against Disruption

[Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) cause changes in the status quo, often presenting a disruption period in between.

During the disruption period the old status quo is no longer in control, its assumptions are violated, but the new status quo still isn't available to be exploited. BlackSwanDAO's [mutual savings bank for 石](../notes/bank.md#liability-is-as-continuous-as-black-swan-events) [hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) to prevent wealth loss during the disruption period and also exploits [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) opportunities after the new status quo emerges.

As the effects of black swans are both disproportional and asymmetric, a [mutual insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_insurance) approach is beneficial to spread the impact of the risks across all [members](../notes/membership.md). Not only the insured [members](../notes/membership.md) are benefited by such insurance contracts, but BlackSwanDAO as a whole benefits, because without [stakeholders](../notes/membership.md#stakeholder) it can't exist and effective [shareholders](../notes/membership.md#shareholder) and [stateholders](../notes/membership.md#stateholder) are crucial to its continued existence.

Individuals buy insurance policies from BlackSwanDAO in order to hedge against specific disruption scenarios, that may be applicable to multiple possible [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). Trying to predict correctly which [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md) will happen is an exercise doomed to incompleteness: by definition we can't foresee [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). At best we can design policies based on [risk profiles](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) that should be sufficently robust to [hedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance) against those specific risks across multiple classes of [black swan](../memes/black-swans.md).

## Insurance as More Than Risk Aversion Arbitrage

Insurance policies are bets made to [hedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) against undesirable outcomes. Unlike bets, insurance policies also cover have additional properties that go beyond a difference in beliefs and expected outcomes:

1. Like bets, people hold insurance policies when they have a difference beliefs and expected outcomes: the home owner thinks the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of losing their house to a fire is greater than the premium they pay while the insurance provider thinks otherwise.
2. [Expected values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) are calculated by averaging out many observations of an event. Insurance policies are useful for events that have few observations: an owner of a thousand homes can average out the loss of a few of them to fires by themselves. Insurance policies offer pools risk from individuals and offers such averages as a service.
3. Insurance policies can offer more [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) than simple pooling, as insurance polices accumulate premium payments made for the insurer they can be offered as collaterals in loans or bundled together with similar assets in larger co-insurance schemes. The insurance company can make such exchanges much faster than a group of individuals pooling risk could.
4. Another kind of [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) offered by insurance companies come from their nature as third parties. The undesirable outcome may put the individual in a situation that reduces their capabilities of liquidating assets fast enough to cover up the losses.
5. Insurance providers can mitigate the impact of undesirable outcomes by means other than direct financial compensation. One aspect of insurance and liquidity that's usually ignored is how they relate to time, which is a scarce resource that once spent can't be recovered. Even with adequate financial compensation for the loss of an asset, the individual still needs to waste time to substitute the asset and continue to derive [insurable interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurable_interest). For example, a cab driver will lose valuable time buying a new car after total loss that was covered by insurance, but an insurance company can provide them a temporary car and reduce this time lost to a minimum as long as they have a fleet of cars that's sufficient to cover the expected total downtime.
6. Through its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) BlackSwanDAO can offer temporal arbitrage, by taking premium payments in different assets and reallocating them to increase the portfolio's value. As long as BlackSwanDAO is effective at [portfolio management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) it will outperform the individual and can either profit from the arbitrage or offer discounts.

## Insurance as Just Risk Aversion Arbitrage

Properties #2 to #5 fall under the category of pooling benefits and unified asset management. They are inherent benefits from insurance providers instead of simpler forms of individual risk management or ad-hoc pools.

Property #6 is an inherent benefit of how BlackSwanDAO [banking system](bank.md) must operate in order to improve its [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency).

Property #1 has an additional benefit in BlackSwanDAO: for [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) the collective capability of [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) to have accurate beliefs with regards to [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md), especially because those are the kind of events that insurance policies will be sold for, is essential for [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) improvement.

In traditional insurance models "the house always wins" otherwise they go bankrupt, but they have additional costs (e.g. personnel, operations) that add to the premiums, beyond what would be necessary to pay out claims. They can increase prices to cover up their own inadequacies. They also are heavily regulated and may be bailed out if they fail, so they have incentives besides merely being as correct as possible.

BlackSwanDAO has no alternative to being as correct as possible. If it increases prices to cover up inadequacies it'll be apparent in record transactions (e.g. the price is a proxy for the risk analysis and incoherencies will be found). [Stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) must have correct beliefs in order to assess the risks, any additional price increases should be a function of the risk (e.g. constant extra or 10% additional price) otherwise the prices and risk assessments are inadequate BlackSwanDAO will fail at the [single problem they focus on solving](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem).

When evaluating insurance risk both [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) and [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) must agree on either what are the actual odds involved or that it's risk aversion arbitrage: one of the parties is more risk averse than the other and is willing to pay more for that preference. As its expected for BlackSwanDAO to be more correctly risk averse on average individuals should see differences in risk evaluation as a signal that their own beliefs are incorrect when compared with BlackSwanDAO as a whole. Similarly, [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) must pay attention to this signal to see if the individual has better information about their particular scenario that must be taken into account.

[Stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) lose money, directly as they pay higher premiums, when they believe correctly the risk is lower than what [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) believe. BlackSwanDAO loses because charging for higher premiums means less insurance policies will be sold.

[Stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) lose money, indirectly as BlackSwanDAO's [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) decreases, when they believe correcly the risk is higher than what [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) believe, because such incorrect beliefs will impact negatively in BlackSwanDAO's [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency). BlackSwanDAO loses because charging for lower premiums means more insurance policies will be sold but the actual risks are higher than the expected ones.

Properties #1 to #6 all offer strong incentives for both [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) and [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder), as each additional and correcly priced insurance policy reduces the expected impact of the loss and improves the odds of correct beliefs being held.

## Insurance as the Failsafe of Last Resort

Claiming an insurance policy against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) means the unexpected happens and we're now in uncharted territories. The policy coverage is a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) [prediction](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem) of what will be useful to [mitigate the impact](../memes/extinction-classes.md) of the event.

The inherent unpredictability of such events means that it's inevitable that some claims will not be as useful as expected.

Traditional insurance policies have clear benefits that don't need ongoing analysis to see if they are still benefits in the future.

Insurance policies for [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) require [ongoing efforts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) to [predict](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-solution-looking-for-a-problem) if they are still expected to be useful and if the probabilities associated with the policy still hold.

A consequence of this ongoing analysis is that particular [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) (that hold insurance policies) and [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) will coordinate towards correct beliefs. A side-effect of this analysis are concrete recommendations that [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) can offer in order to reduce the probabilities (e.g. moving to a safer location).

Insurance policies offered by BlackSwanDAO are based on the doctrine of "[mutual assured continuity](meta.md#mutual-assured-continuity)": both parties have incentives in improving each other's odds of continued existence.

―  [John Perry Barlow, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

Passengers on the Titanic could, at best, buy life insurance policies. Such policies would be in general terms (e.g. death by food poisoning) and probably wouldn't emphasize on the unthinkable: the sinking of an ["unsinkable" ship](https://www.britannica.com/story/did-anyone-really-think-the-titanic-was-unsinkable).

BlackSwanDAO would sell such policies, but it could also offer "unthinkable" services and have the policies cover them: if sufficient passengers bought policies it could hire a boat to travel near the Titanic, carrying a cargo of some sorts to reduce the costs, and rescue the passengers in the case of catastrophe.

Out of box thinking is necessary to deal with [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md): traditional policies offer monetary compensation, which is useful when the status quo is preserved, but after the disruption happens money may be temporarily worthless.

Some possible types of insurance that BlackSwanDAO may offer:

- Evacuation from bad situations, i.e. "BadSitEvac™". Those range from the outcomes of extreme climate events (e.g. flooding) to civil wars and pandemic mismanagement.

  Coverage may include a specific flight plan that moves the insured from one country to another and covers temporary hotel accomodations, this is useful for the pandemic scenario in which international flights are limited and quarantine time in stopover countries may be legally required.

  In some situations copayment may be necessary to cover unexpected price surges. e.g. evacuation from a flooded region may include helicopter flights, but their prices may increase due to legal changes, even though a contingent contract was already agreed with the helicopter company.

- Life insurance against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md). Those policies are supposed to offer payments that severely affect BlackSwanDAO's [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency). The purpose behind those policies is to have [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) worried about such [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) and being "proactive bodyguards", continuously evaluating their situation and offering actionable advice to reduce the odds of such impacts.

  Those policies are contingent on [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) making [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) follow-up to the actionable advice. e.g. if the [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) advice them to move away from that particular city/country and make a contract for copayment of moving expenses and the insured doesn't follow up the advice but offers no reasonable explanation, then it may be considered negligence.

  This can be considered the most extreme example of the doctrine of "mutual assured continuity," as both parties have strong incentives for each others continued existence. As long as they are reasonable and argue convincingly they can move towards more mutually profitable positions.

- Jurisdiction arbitrage for [personal extinction events](../memes/extinction-classes.md): both [medical tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism) and [suicide tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_tourism) are examples of extreme personal events that require jurisdiction arbitrage. e.g. an insured buys a policy covering [medical tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism) expenses that includes travel and accomodation costs, and possible procedures, specific copayment plans for the different situations may be part of the policy.

  [Suicide tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_tourism) is another extreme example and it also is different from the continuity focus offered by BlackSwanDAO, but paradoxically it seems to be something that many [members](../notes/membership.md) also want to keep as an option: continuity is for preserving life that's worth living, a measure thats subjective and deeply personal, but at some point [members](../notes/membership.md) that care for continuity will also think about such hard decisions. A policy for this kind of extreme event covers up travel and accomodation costs, including loved ones, and legal costs (e.g. lawyers for writing testaments/wills).
