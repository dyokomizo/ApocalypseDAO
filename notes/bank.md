## A Currency for Continuity

[石 (koku)](koku.md) is both a concrete and an abstract currency. It has a precise meaning, i.e. the amount of energy for the continued existence of a single human being for a year, but it also is imprecise as there's no simple process that can ensure one [石](koku.md) can be redeemed for that amount of energy in a form appropriate for human consumption.

BlackSwanDAO's [mission](NEW-TOP-LEVEL-README.md) is enabled by [石 as a foundational unit of management](koku.md#石-as-the-foundational-unit-of-management). [Continuity is measured in 石s](koku.md#石-as-the-quintessential-unit-of-continuity) and [risk management](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) is a natural consequence of continuity management.

[石高 (kokudaka)](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) is a measure of BlackSwanDAO's [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency): as long as it's [understood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_system) that BlackSwanDAO's [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) can fulfill all of its 石 liabilities in real world terms (e.g. actually delivering the equivalent amounts of rough rice) then BlackSwanDAO is [predicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_system) to be [solvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency).

First and foremost [石](koku.md) is [market priced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_system), but like [representative money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) it's backed by both BlackSwanDAO's reputation and its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

BlackSwanDAO holds an [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) to back the value of [石](koku.md) much like a [mutual saving bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_savings_bank) holds monetary assets for its members. The primary difference is that [mutual saving banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_savings_bank) don't have to worry about the monetary value of its assets, as they are primarily used for holding monetary assets of [traditional currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency).

This [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) is not correlated with the assets that are commonly viewed as the cornerstones of modern society. This anti-correlation [hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) against [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) as they primarily break the assumptions held by the status quo.

## Tokens as Proxies for Market Prices

[石](koku.md) tokens are [cryptographic tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Crypto_token) that are minted by BlackSwanDAO whenever [石](koku.md) contracts are bought. The transfer of assets to BlackSwanDAO's holdings determines the [market price for 石 as an asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_pricing).

For example, let's say BlackSwanDAO uses [rough rice futures contract](https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-contracts) (pricing in hundredweight, which equals to 100 lb or 30.3% of one 石) to assess the [market price for rough rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_pricing). At the time of a purchase of a contract worth one [石](koku.md) the hundredweight price for [rough rice futures contract](https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-contracts) is $11.605, which prices one [石](koku.md) at $38.2965. The buyer transfers 0.0974 ETH to BlackSwanDAO, because within the same time frame the exchange rate for ETH/USD is $393.44.

This simple transaction illustrates most of the crucial aspects surrounding [石](koku.md) management.

1. The use of [rough rice futures contract](https://www.investing.com/commodities/rough-rice-contracts) as a proxy for how much will actually cost to acquire and deliver rough rice is both incomplete (e.g. prices don't cover delivery) and incorrect (e.g. prices are subjected to distortion by government subsidies or market failures). BlackSwanDAO must take those factors into consideration. As each [石](koku.md) contract is sold additional considerations will come into play and affect the final price. For example, if [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) believe that BlackSwanDAO is underestimating its own capabilities they will predict the market price is too low and decide to buy more [石](koku.md). Similarly if they think it's the reverse situation, they'll sell [石](koku.md) tokens in open exchanges for lower than current market prices. This [signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) happens without an explicit mechanism to "fix" the prices of [石](koku.md) contracts.
2. The prices are in USD, which is a proxy for actual value. [Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) can cause its devaluation, so using USD or other currencies is at best only useful for examples. At worst it brings into play a perspective that's harmful for continuity, which is the fundamental reason for using [石](koku.md) in the first place.
3. The transfer of ETH assets to BlackSwanDAO changes the composition of its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), i.e. it increases the share of ETH in the portfolio. Such unexamined reallocation is dangerous for BlackSwanDAO as it compromises it's [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency). A more robust [石](koku.md) contract offer would deal with such problems by offering price differentials allowing for mutually benefitial [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) (e.g. the [石](koku.md) contract buyer can use out of band mechanisms to acquire assets more profitably and BlackSwanDAO gains assets that can be more effectively exchanged and/or don't impact disproportionately in its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).
4. Selling the contract for one [石](koku.md) increases BlackSwanDAO's liabilities by one [石](koku.md). Its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) is a proxy for the capability of fulfilling those liabilities today, but it's necessary to manage it so that it can continuously have this capability.

## Portfolios as Jurisdiction Arbitrage, Across Time and Space

Ideally BlackSwanDAO should leverage every exchange to improve its [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency): every proposal for selling [石](koku.md) contracts, reallocating its [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), or introducing new rules to improve its [risk management](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) capabilities, all of them should be focused on [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth).

Every exchange is an [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) opportunity, it should focus on ["buying low and selling high"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)) even when it means ["buying high and selling at even higher"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing).

[Arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) happens across jurisdictions, either due to [market inefficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure) or due to [regulatory failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_economics). Markets in different jurisdictions have different properties, actors, and regulatory environment, all of which offer opportunities for arbitrage. [Temporal arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-arbitrage.asp) is especially useful for BlackSwanDAO, because its [prediction](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html) and [risk management](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) capabilities are well suited for profiting from long term trends and risks.

An obvious failure mode of intertwining those three aspects is correlating predictions with expectations: BlackSwanDAO institutions are designed to reward [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) that have [correct beliefs](reputation.md#名-is-not-a-privilege-of-the-individual) about the outcome of specific proposals. [Shareholders](membership.md#shareholder) should make their proposals safer by judicious use of mechanisms, such as [hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)).

## Liability is as Continuous as Black Swan Events

[Black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) are discontinuous in the long term scale, in both space and time. BlackSwanDAO works to mitigate the impacts of the disruption period and to [hold long positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)) after the new status quo emerges. The latter was the subject of this document so far, now we need to focus on liabilities.

Suppose BlackSwanDAO has 10,000 [石](koku.md) worth of liabilities, let's say 1,000 [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) across the globe have bought such contracts. One way of handling this scenario is for BlackSwanDAO to have an [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) that can cover the sudden torrent of claims totalling 10,000 [石](koku.md). This strategy is the most conservative and risk-averse one, which is naively the preferable one for BlackSwanDAO but, in practice, effective [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) will tell you it's damaging: it focus our portfolio on risk-averse assets, but in the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) there are no safe assets.

Building a portfolio the maximize the odds of fulfilling 10,000 [石](koku.md) worth of liabilities today means we increase the odds of catastrophic failure when safe assets become unsafe after the current status quo is disrupted.

To follow such strategies is to make BlackSwanDAO worthless when it's most needed.

That discontinuity offers [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) opportunities that are exploitable by BlackSwanDAO, as soon as now. It's necessary to plan for those opportunites in the [allocation of the assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), e.g. assets that can be move across spatial jurisdictions, stashed and held across temporal jurisdictions, trading present against future when selling future liabilities. The more we can extend BlackSwanDAO's [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) capabilities of withstanding disruptions the better we can fulfill its liabilities.

In the face of black swans all assumptions are off, but bets increase ten-fold in importance.

The safest bet is betting that no asset is safe, but some assets are safer than others. A good bet is that today's safe assets are held by all [members](membership.md), e.g. they have an financial institutions to hold their USD assets, the value of BlackSwanDAO is in complementing those assets.

## Contracting for Tokens and Futures

The base use case for [石](koku.md) purchase is through contracts that immediately mint [石](koku.md) tokens in exchange for assets. The risk analysis for this kind of transactions is more straightforward because the time frame of the assets valuation is both much closer to the present and much smaller.

[Contracts for futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) are a standard way to negotiate assets in the future. Offering contracts for future [石](koku.md) gives us another kind of tokens, all such contracts are fungible when pooled with same delivery date contracts, and bundles with different delivery dates can be priced as a portfolio. Having such futures tokens opens up the possibilities of external markets to trade them, giving BlackSwanDAO valuable information about how such markets are estimating its future capabilities. It also opens the door for speculation, which is desirable given that BlackSwanDAO favors having correct information much more than having "fair" trades: correct information is necessary for long-term continuity. As long as "unfair" trades don't affect continuity odds they are a "fair game."

One useful feature of futures is to offer bounded and specific terms for discounts: it's possible to sell [石](koku.md) at different prices, heavily discounting future [石](koku.md) because it's not a present liability and the [prospects of prosperity](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) should be both sufficient and necessary to justify such discounts: increasing present assets with a clear path to increase [石高](koku.md#石-as-the-symbolic-unit-of-wealth) and [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) minimizes long-term risk. Bulk discounts are time asymmetric, but [temporal price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination) in the form of discounted [futures contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) are a standard tool no manage such asymmetries.

Going back to our previous example, with 10,000 [石](koku.md) worth of liabilities claimable by 1,000 [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) across the globe we probably are talking by a fraction of such liabilities being immediately claimable, it makes no sense for [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) to claim much more than one [石](koku.md) per year, unless they are holding them as proxies for family and friends, or expect additional costs beyond [basic survival](koku.md#石-as-the-concrete-unit-of-life). Even in such cases [stakeholders](membership.md#stakeholder) will have differing expectations about their future and would be planning for multiple years of claims. Futures are a way to buy contracts at a discount that give them access to assets across a period of time, which reduce BlackSwanDAO's present liabilities.

[Net present value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) is a standard way to calculate the present worth of future assets that have discounted rates.

## The Availability of Liability Claims is the Measure of Solvency

Given BlackSwanDAO's [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) and the [net present value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) of its liabilities, it's possible to assess its [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency). It's a myth that it's a simple comparison of assets and liabilities, because it's based on the assumption that the underlying system is working and it's capable of making those exchanges at the necessary [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity).

In the face of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md) all assumptions are off, but bets increase ten-fold in importance.

BlackSwanDAO measures its [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) in terms of probabilities given [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_system).

For example, what are the odds of a temporary, but significant, worldwide Internet outage? This event decreases the liquidity of [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) assets and makes it harder for BlackSwanDAO to fulfill claims made in that period.

To assess BlackSwanDAO solvency it's necessary to evaluate the risks of different scenarios and figure out its odds of fulfilling the claims.

[Systems availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation) is usually measure in the percentage of a time frame in which the system can perform at some capacity. This measure is useful to think about extreme events and fallback plans.

At BlackSwanDAO, it can be used to assess the odds of it fulfilling a percentage of its claimable liabilities.

For example, suppose BlackSwanDAO has 500 [石](koku.md) worth of immediately claimable liabilities and has an [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) worth 10,000 [石](koku.md). Through careful analysis of different scenarios the [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder) can conclude it has 99% availability to fulfill 100% of those liabilities, i.e. 3.65 days out of every year parts of the [assets portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) may be unavailable or it won't be possible to fulfill the claims (e.g. unavailability of rice sellers). They can also conclude it has 99.9% availability for 60% of those liabilites (e.g. BlackSwanDAO actually has drones for rice delivery and stashes all over the globe).

Availability calculations give different results in different scenarios (e.g. different time frames in the future, different types of [black swans](../memes/black-swans.md)), it's necessary to assess those odds against the plausibility of each scenario.

As this calculation is necessary to evaluate if proposals should be accepted (i.e. they increase the [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) odds) its an ongoing effort to have [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_system) made by [stateholders](membership.md#stateholder), which provide the guideline for all [risk management](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/practical-risk-management-approach-8248) efforts.

## Why 石 is the Way

> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
>
> Write programs to work together.
>
> Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
― [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

An universal interface is exists in [石 as the quintessential unit of continuity](koku.md#石-as-the-quintessential-unit-of-continuity), all services offered by BlackSwanDAO work together because of this: [石 as a foundational unit of management](koku.md#石-as-the-foundational-unit-of-management) gives it one thing to do and do it well.

[石](koku.md) management is the foundation and [modern portfolio theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) is the strategy to make this foundation as solid as possible. [石](koku.md) becomes a late failure, most of its component assets need to fail catastrophically before BlackSwanDAO's [solvency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency) is sufficiently compromised: [石](koku.md) fails exactly at [midnight](https://medium.com/@dyokomizo/the-nuclear-bad-ending-84e0c90ac951).
